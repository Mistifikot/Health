# Health Quest Website

This repository contains a single-page health quest application.

## GitHub Pages

The site can be hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

1. Open the repository **Settings** and go to **Pages**.
2. Select the `work` branch and the `/` (root) folder as the source.
3. Save the settings. After a few moments the site will be available at
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/Health/`.

An optional GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) is provided to
automatically deploy the site whenever you push changes to the `work` branch.
